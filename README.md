# shagaan_backend

This repo is displaying the backend work from a bigger project.
The repo is still a work in progress.
The project was meant for a person to set up a guest list and invite people via text message.
Eventually the project is meant to maintain a list of people that have given you money so in the future you are able to
equally reciprocate an equal amount.

This idea came about after my wedding where I found my mother and mother in law keeping track of who gave how much money so in the future
they are able to reciprocate an equal or more amount.  They were counting large sums of moeny and then keeping track of who gave what in a notebook, so
I figured this could be better.
